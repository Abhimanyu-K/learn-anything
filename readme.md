# Learn Anything

> Organize world's knowledge, explore relations and curate learning paths

## What is it

The vision of project is to create the best platform possible for learning any topic as well as finding & building novel ideas together.

Please read [our roadmap](https://docs.learn-anything.xyz/roadmap) where we outline the problems we want to solve with building this platform and how we plan to solve them.

If you are interested in helping us out, please join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KKYdWjt) to learn & build this project together.

Roughly, these are the areas LA tries to tackle:

- **Learn**: Powerful personal link manager. Curated study guides for learning any topic. Knowledge graph of topics to learn.
- **Explore**: Powerful tools to connect learned topics together. Explore global map of all the topics to learn.
- **Ideas**: Powerful tools to track & manage personal ideas. Find people to work on ideas together. Get direct support for your novel ideas.

## Help us build it

2. Present links on website (done)
