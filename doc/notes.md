# Data model

# 1. Store, retrieve links

- setup prisma
- model for links basic, title, url
- be able to save, retrieve links from web
- be able to save, retrieve links from CLI (check [this](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learning/blob/master/go/savelink/main.go), does nearly same but saves to a file, instead of DB)
  - https://github.com/cli/cli for inspiration of nice CLI design (good `-h` etc)
